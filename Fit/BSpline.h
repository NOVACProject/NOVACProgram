/**
 * Base class for a spline object containing the nodes for a given domain,
 * cutoff wavelength, and boundary condition.  To smooth a single curve,
 * the BSpline interface contains a constructor which both sets up the
 * domain and solves for the spline.  Subsequent curves over the same
 * domain can be created by apply()ing them to the BSpline object, where
 * apply() is a BSplineBase method.  [See \Ref{apply}.]  New curves can
 * also be smoothed within the same BSpline object by calling solve() with
 * the new set of y values.  [See \Ref{BSpline}.]  A BSplineBase can be
 * created on its own, in which case all of the computations dependent on
 * the x values, boundary conditions, and cutoff wavelength have already
 * been completed.
 *
 * The solution of the cubic b-spline is divided into two parts.  The first
 * is the setup of the domain given the x values, boundary conditions, and
 * wavelength.  The second is the solution of the spline for a set of y
 * values corresponding to the x values in the domain.  The first part is
 * done in the creation of the BSplineBase object (or when calling the
 * setDomain method).  The second part is done when creating a BSpline
 * object (or calling solve() on a BSpline object).
 *
 * A BSpline object can be created with either one of its constructors, or
 * by calling apply() on an existing BSplineBase object.  Once a spline has
 * been solved, it can be evaluated at any x value.  The following example
 * creates a spline curve and evaluates it over the domain:
 *
\begin{verbatim}

    vector<float> x;
    vector<float> y;
    { ... }
    int bc = BSplineBase<float>::BC_ZERO_SECOND;
    BSpline<float>::Debug = true;
    BSpline<float> spline (x.begin(), x.size(), y.begin(), wl, bc);
    if (spline.ok())
    {
        ostream_iterator<float> of(cout, "\t ");
    	float xi = spline.Xmin();
	float xs = (spline.Xmax() - xi) / 2000.0;
	for (; x <= spline.Xmax(); x += xs)
	{
	    *of++ = spline.evaluate (xi);
	}
    }
 
\end{verbatim}
 *
 * The interface for the BSplineBase and BSpline templates is defined in 
 * the header file BSpline.h.  The implementation is defined in BSpline.cxx.
 * Source files which will instantiate the template should include the
 * implementation file and {\em not} the interface.  If the implementation
 * for a specific type will be linked from elsewhere, such as a
 * static library or Windows DLL, source files should only include the 
 * interface file.  On Windows, applications should link with the import
 * library BSpline.lib and make sure BSpline.dll is on the path.  The DLL
 * contains an implementation for BSpline<float> and BSpline<double>.
 * For debugging, an application can include the implementation to get its
 * own instantiation.
 *
 * The algorithm is based on the cubic spline described by Katsuyuki Ooyama
 * in Montly Weather Review, Vol 115, October 1987.  This implementation
 * has benefited from comparisons with a previous FORTRAN implementation by
 * James L. Franklin, NOAA/Hurricane Research Division.  The cubic b-spline
 * is formulated as the sum of some multiple of the basis function centered
 * at each node in the domain.  The number of nodes is determined by the
 * desired cutoff wavelength and a desirable number of x values per node.
 * The basis function is continuous and differentiable up to the second
 * degree.  A derivative constraint is included in the solution to achieve
 * the effect of a low-pass frequency filter with the given cutoff
 * wavelength.  The domain nodes, boundary constraints, and wavelength
 * determine a linear system of equations, Qa=b, where a is the vector of
 * basis function coefficients at each node.  The coefficient vector is
 * solved by first LU factoring along the diagonally banded matrix Q in
 * BSplineBase.  The BSpline object then computes the B vector for a set of
 * y values and solves for the coefficient vector with the LU matrix.  Only
 * the diagonal bands are stored in memory and calculated during LU
 * factoring and back substitution, and the basis function is evaluated as
 * few times as possible in computing the diagonal matrix and B vector.
